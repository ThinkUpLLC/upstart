            <div class="content">
              <p>ThinkUp is a brand new app that connects your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social networking accounts and tells you what matters about the time you spent there. ThinkUp can help you have more fun with friends, connect better with your network, and even learn a little bit about yourself.</p>

              <p>ThinkUp is also our new company, focused on the idea that people are looking for tech companies they can trust. We're putting our users and community first, because we think that's the best way to create a better web for everyone.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>ThinkUp is like a friend who  points out the coolest things about your social network, the stuff you can't find anywhere else. You just open up the app on your phone, tablet or computer, and see insights like these:</p>
                <ul class="insight-examples">
                  <li class="happy">Did that tweet I sent out make people happy?</li>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Our cofounders, Gina Trapani and Anil Dash, have been working on ThinkUp together for a few years. Gina helped build one of the earliest social networks for teens, was the founding editor of Lifehacker and hosts the popular podcasts “This Week in Google” and “In Beta.” She also created Todo.txt. Anil has been writing since the late 90s on his personal blog and in magazines such as Wired, and helped launch Movable Type, which powered the early blogosphere.</p>

              <p>Gina and Anil have advocated for the idea of more thoughtful technology and a better Internet for more than a decade. Instead of just writing or talking about it, ThinkUp is an effort to actually build a company and product that can make those goals happen. We’ve already joined forces with an enthusiastic and diverse open source community of contributors around the world who believe in that vision and in our product. We hope you'll be the next to join our community by becoming a member of ThinkUp.</p>

            <header>What’s the goal of this campaign?</header>
            <div class="content">
              <p>We want to build a great tech company that’s focused on doing the right thing for our users, our community, and the web. We're doing this by making an app that shows people exactly how meaningful their online interactions can be.</p>

              <p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise enough money to focus on making a great product. This means we must:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Raise enough money to make ThinkUp sustainable as a company.</li>
                <li>Develop a business model where we are as accountable to our users as we are to investors and aligned with what our users care about.</li>
                <li>Be ready not just to launch, but to keep building for the long-term.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>You can join ThinkUp now at the <strong class="level-span">Member</strong>, <strong class="level-span">Pro</strong> or <strong class="level-span">Executive</strong> level, and be one of the very first users of ThinkUp in early 2014. When you do, you’ll help make ThinkUp available to everyone.</p>

            <header>What do I get for backing ThinkUp?</header>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Every backer at every level gets great <strong class="level-span">Member</strong> benefits as soon as we launch:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>First place in line to reserve your username on ThinkUp, and immediate access when we launch in January 2014.</li>
                <li>ThinkUp insights for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, with Instagram, Google+ and Foursquare to follow</li>
                <li>A lock on the early-bird price.</li>
                <li>An exclusive, brand new e-book, <i>Insights</i>, which explains the future of social networking based on interviews with dozens of the most creative and influential users of social media.</li>
                <li>The ability to weigh in on changes to ThinkUp’s features, terms of service and product roadmap before those changes happen.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The <strong class="level-span">Pro</strong> level is great for experts and geeks, or anyone with <strong>more than one account</strong> on any given social network. You also get access to new beta ThinkUp features as they’re developed, and APIs and data services for building cool apps on top of ThinkUp.</p>

              <p>At the <strong class="level-span">Executive</strong> level, you get all of the benefits of Member and Pro, plus the things that businesses, institutions or power users care about most. You’ll get email updates direct from ThinkUp’s founders with information about our company's inner workings. We’ll consult with you before making changes that might impact parts of your business that rely on ThinkUp. You’ll also get a personalized version of the <em>Insights</em> book, inscribed with a message from our founders that’s custom-tailored to how you use social networks.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <ul class="faq">
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Is this the same app you guys launched two years ago?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">No! We tore that all apart and made a whole new app on top of that engine. Now ThinkUp has a sleek new look. (We kept the name ThinkUp because it's an awesome name.)</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">What happened to Expert Labs?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">That's the non-profit research project where ThinkUp was born. It was always designed as a limited-duration project, so when it ended we focused on how to bring its output, like ThinkUp, to a broader audience. We're extremely thankful to the MacArthur Foundation and AAAS for shepherding the earliest versions of what would become our work today.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Is ThinkUp a business tool? For personal users?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">ThinkUp is for <em>people</em>. What that means is, it can be used by individuals or by businesses or organizations, but people use ThinkUp because they love it, not because their employer says they <em>have</em> to.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Do you have a native mobile app for iPhone or Android? Can I get push notifications?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">We don't yet. But if we get enough backers for this campaign, we'll be able to do those kinds of apps sooner! If you want to build one around our APIs, get in touch.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Isn’t ThinkUp open source? Can I run it on my own? Is ThinkUp.com any different?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>It sure is, and if you have the tech skills to run it on your own server, we think that's awesome! (It is roughly about the same amount of work as getting WordPress running on your server.)</p>

                  <p>The version of ThinkUp that you grab from <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp">GitHub</a> and put on your server is exactly the same as what we run on ThinkUp.com, though we've built some systems around it for managing payments and some other infrastructure details.</p></div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">I’m a developer! How can I build insights for ThinkUp?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Oh we love this question! Right now, there's a "Hello World" example insight that you can learn from, but we'll be publishing full API docs and a style guide for insights soon so you can really go crazy. It's just a short wait until we finalize the way those APIs and design elements look.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">How is ThinkUp different from a stats or analytics app? Is it like Klout? Is it like HootSuite?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We're very different from those kinds of apps in our philosophy. We think most people who tweet or post a status update aren't motivated by statictics or some abstract "engagement metric". We think people participate in social networks because they want to make real connections, and to make people happy, and to learn new things. So we've optimized for telling stories within ThinkUp that are focused on those goals.</p>

                  <p>Of course, some people want to keep score, or have to produce analytics reports for their Chief Marketing Officer. In that case, you should definitely use those other tools alongside ThinkUp - they'll help you create those reports, and we'll help you feel good about the time you spend on social networks.</p></div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">What does “quantified selfies” mean?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>It's a play on the idea of "quantified self", which is the process of tracking aspects of your life in order to better understand them or improve them. When people log all the food they eat in a spreadsheet so that they can eat more healthy foods, that's quantified self.</p>

                  <p>In the case of ThinkUp, "quantified selfies" is riffing on the idea that analyzing what we do in our fun, sometimes silly, sometimes serious activities on social networks could be meaningful, too.</p></div>

                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Are you hiring?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Maybe soon! It partially depends on how this funding campaign goes. The good news is that, if you've got something to contribute, you can do that now and we'll work to make it worth your while. Some people have contributed code to ThinkUp and we helped the get jobs at companies like Facebook or Google before we had a company ourselves. Some helped on design or documentation and we were able to refer more work to them, or hire them for projects. And some have been helpful in building the community, by answering questions or writing up useful blog posts, and we greet them with warm hugs and buy coffee when we're in the same town because it's great to make friends.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">What are you being huge hypocrites about?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Probably a bunch of stuff! Here are some of the ones we’re aware of so far, and let us know what we’re missing.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>By starting with a paid set of users, we run the dangers of catering to a set of people and companies who have the disposable income to join something like this.</strong> We plan to address this with deliberate efforts at inclusion once ThinkUp is available more broadly, but our judgment was that the benefits of a sustainable company were a prerequisite to addressing the larger issues of who we’re serving with ThinkUp.</li>
                      <li><strong>Since ThinkUp only supports a U.S. English user interface, most of the world won’t get much value from it.</strong> If we want to help everybody on social networks, why serve such a narrow audience? Really, the answer is just that we have limited resources. We definitely want to localize and internationalize ThinkUp for everyone, and once we’ve got a thriving company, we can prioritize exactly that kind of project.</li>
                      <li><strong>By offering a hosted version of ThinkUp instead of just the open source app that people install on their own servers, we’re making the social web more centralized.</strong> This one is something we struggled with for a long time. The reality is, it’s just much easier to make a user experience that’s as good as what people expect by having things at a simple website where people can sign up. We are putting a lot of effort into making sure the open source app and ThinkUp.com stay perfectly in sync, so that there’s a great experience whether you’re on our service or not.</li>
                      <li><strong>ThinkUp is really just for those who already have big social networks, and helps the already-successful get even more successful.</strong> This one’s a legitimate criticism -- right now ThinkUp is more useful for folks that already have some kind of network. But our goal is to keep iterating so that it can be of use to anybody, no matter how many connections they have online.</li>
                      <li><strong>You say you want your community to be open and welcoming, but your CEO is always going on rants on Twitter.</strong> Yeah, Anil can be pretty annoying sometimes. But our fundamental principle is that our community and the things they can do matter more than any one person. We hope to welcome folks into the ThinkUp community who are pointedly, and constructively, critical about everything we do.</li>
                      <li><strong>Isn’t taking funding from VCs evil? Aren’t you really critical of venture capital?</strong> We sure are. Much of the system, and many of its participants, can encourage things that we think are bad for the web, or for society. So we took a really long time, and had a lot of really in-depth conversations, in our process of vetting the investors that we work with. We’re confident that we’ve found people who respect our values and care about the web, and that’s why we’re happy to make them part of bringing ThinkUp to the world.</li>
                      <li><strong>You’re not being open enough!</strong> This one’s kinda vague, but it can certainly be argued that there are parts of what we do that are less open. (For example, our payment system isn’t open source like ThinkUp itself is.) We’re open to feedback on this, but the goal is for us to go as far as is humanly possible in sharing the functioning of our company with our community and our users, so we’ll rely on you to keep us honest.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">How come you’re doing a crowdfunding campaign if you’ve raised funding?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We raised a little bit of funding to be able to do immediate work like this crowdfunding campaign and to pay folks like professional designers to make ThinkUp good enough for the world to use.</p>

                  <p>But we're doing this crowdfunding campaign because that's what it's going to take to get ThinkUp out to the whole world. We need your help to make it real, and to prove there's demand for this kind of app and this kind of company.</p></div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Why aren’t you using Kickstarter or IndieGogo?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">We love those platforms! But we wanted to focus on a subscription plan for our app, and we had to build that system anyway, so we thought it’d be easiest for our users if we just had one integrated system that was easy enough to use. By going with Amazon payments, it should be just as easy to become a ThinkUp member as it is to back a Kickstarter campaign.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Is this all or nothing? What if you don't meet your goal?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">No, we’re launching no matter what. But if we don’t make our goal, we’ll have to spend more time thinking about our business model and working with our users to figure out how to make ThinkUp sustainable and how to support its growth going forward.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">How come you don’t show the app in your little video? Is this thing real?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">It’s totally real! We just are in the process of an extensive redesign of the app and didn’t want to show off the old version too much because the new one is so much nicer looking. You can check out this demo if you want to see how the old version looks: <a href="http://thinkup.com/demo/ginatrapani">http://thinkup.com/demo/ginatrapani</a></div>

                  <div class="faq-question">How do I know you can make this thing work?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Our founders have built apps, and companies, before, and learned a lot from doing so. Anil helped start up Six Apart, the company that made Movable Type and TypePad, which was one of the first paid hosted services for people to sign up for on the Internet. Gina’s had a number of successful open source apps and projects, from Todo.txt today to Better Gmail and many other apps in the past, in addition to cofounding Lifehacker. Best of all, we’ve got a lot of help from our community, and from our friends who’ve made some pretty big apps and sites, too.</div>

                  <div class="faq-answer">All the members who join in this campaign will be able to use ThinkUp on January 15th. We know that some people have been waiting a long while for the chance to use the app, and we’re sorry it took so long. We just wanted to take our time and get things right in the process of building ThinkUp not just as an app, but as a company.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">I joined, but I don't see a charge in my Amazon account. How come?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">You won’t be charged until January 15, 2014. We’ll remind you before then so that you’re not surprised with a credit card charge right after the holidays.</div>

(A good way to do that is to forward your Amazon confirmation email to <a href="mailto:help@thinkup.com">help@thinkup.com</a> and just tell us at the top of the email what level you want to switch to.)</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">I've joined. When can I choose my ThinkUp username?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">We’ll let you pick your username on January 15th when we launch. Or if we can get it built sooner than that, we’ll just tell you when it’s ready. (We’re still in the middle of making that part of ThinkUp.)</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Does ThinkUp support languages other than U.S. English?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Not yet! ThinkUp’s interface is (currently) entirely in U.S. English, so you should be comfortable reading English if you want to use it now. We’re hoping to add more languages in the future.</div>

                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Which devices does ThinkUp work with?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">ThinkUp is just a simple web app, so it should work on any common device. We test on Mac and PC computers, iPad and Android tablets, and iPhones and Android phones. Anil has a Microsoft Surface, so we even fire it up on there sometimes.</div>

                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Which browsers does ThinkUp work in?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Any browser released in the last 5 or so years should work fine. We test things out on Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. We test on Chrome and Safari on mobile devices too. We love you Opera folks, so please don’t email us, because ThinkUp will probably work, but we just don’t test on there. It probably won’t work well on that weird web browser thing on the Nintendo Wii.</div>
