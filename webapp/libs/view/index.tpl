              <p>ThinkUp is a brand new app that connects your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social networking accounts and tells you what matters about the time you spent there. ThinkUp can help you have more fun with friends, connect better with your network, and even learn a little bit about yourself.</p>

              <p>ThinkUp is also our new company, focused on the idea that people are looking for tech companies they can trust. We're putting our users and community first, because we think that's the best way to create a better web for everyone.</p>

              <p>ThinkUp is like a friend who  points out the coolest things about your social network, the stuff you can't find anywhere else. You just open up the app on your phone, tablet or computer, and see insights like these:</p>

              </div>

              <p>Our cofounders, Gina Trapani and Anil Dash, have been working on ThinkUp together for a few years. Gina was the founding editor of Lifehacker, helped build one of the earliest social networks for teens, created Todo.txt, and hosts the popular podcasts “This Week in Google” and “In Beta.” Anil has been writing since the late 90s on his personal blog and in magazines such as Wired, and helped launch Movable Type, which powered the early blogosphere.</p>

              <p>Gina and Anil have advocated for the idea of more thoughtful technology and a better Internet for more than a decade. Instead of just writing or talking about it, ThinkUp is an effort to actually build a company and product that can make those goals happen. We’ve already joined forces with an enthusiastic and diverse open source community of contributors around the world who believe in that vision and in our product. We hope you'll be the next to join our community by becoming a member of ThinkUp.</p>

            <header>What’s the goal of this campaign?</header>
            <div class="content">
              <p>We want to build a great tech company that’s focused on doing the right thing for our users, our community, and the web. We're doing this by making an app that shows people exactly how meaningful their online interactions can be.</p>

              <p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise enough money to focus on making a great product. This means we must:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Make ThinkUp sustainable as a company by inspiring enough people to become members with active yearly subscriptions.</li>
                <li>Develop a business model that makes us as accountable to our users as we are to investors.</li>
                <li>Be ready not just to launch once, but to keep iterating and evolving over the long-term.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>You can join ThinkUp now at the <strong class="level-span">Member</strong>, <strong class="level-span">Pro</strong> or <strong class="level-span">Executive</strong> level, and be one of the very first users of ThinkUp in early 2014. When you do, you’ll help make ThinkUp available to everyone.</p>

            <header>What do I get for backing ThinkUp?</header>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Every backer at every level gets great <strong class="level-span">Member</strong> benefits as soon as we launch:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>First place in line to reserve your username on ThinkUp, and immediate access when we launch in January 2014.</li>
                <li>ThinkUp insights for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, with Instagram, Google+ and Foursquare to follow</li>
                <li>A lock on the early-bird price.</li>
                <li>An exclusive, brand new e-book, <i>Insights</i>, which explains the future of social networking based on interviews with dozens of the most creative and influential users of social media. <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com">Preview the interviews on the ThinkUp blog.</a></li>
                <li>The ability to weigh in on changes to ThinkUp’s features, terms of service and product roadmap before those changes happen.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The <strong class="level-span">Pro</strong> level is great for experts and geeks, or anyone with <strong>more than one account</strong> on any given social network. You also get access to new beta ThinkUp features as they’re developed, and APIs and data services for building cool apps on top of ThinkUp.</p>

              <p>At the <strong class="level-span">Executive</strong> level, you get all of the benefits of Member and Pro, plus the things that businesses, institutions or power users care about most. You’ll get email updates direct from ThinkUp’s founders with information about our company's inner workings. We’ll consult with you before making changes that might impact parts of your business that rely on ThinkUp. You’ll also get a personalized version of the <em>Insights</em> book, inscribed with a message from our founders that’s custom-tailored to how you use social networks.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <ul class="faq">
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-is-it-klout">
                  <div class="faq-question">How is ThinkUp different from a stats or analytics app? Is it like Klout? Is it like HootSuite?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We think most people who tweet or post a status update aren't motivated by statictics or some abstract "engagement metric". We think people participate in social networks because they want to make real connections, and to make people happy, and to learn new things. So we've focused on telling stories within ThinkUp that are focused on those goals.</p>
                  <p>Of course, some people want to keep score, or need to produce analytics reports. In that case, you should definitely use those other tools alongside ThinkUp - they'll help you create those reports, and we'll help you feel good about the time you spend on social networks.</p></div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-for-business-or-humans">
                  <div class="faq-question">Is ThinkUp a business tool? For personal users?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">ThinkUp is for <em>people</em>. What that means is, it can be used by individuals or by businesses or organizations, but people use ThinkUp because they love it, not because their employer says they <em>have</em> to.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-popularity-contest">
                  <div class="faq-question">Is ThinkUp just for people with tons of friends or followers?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Nope. We want it to help <em>anyone</em> get more out of the time they spend on their social networks. Obviously, some kinds of insights will be dependent on how many connections you have to your network, and that's one of the reasons we have the <strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>Executive</strong> level memberships, so we can make a good experience for everyone.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-where-are-the-screenshots">
                  <div class="faq-question">How come you don’t show the app in your little video? Is this thing real?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">It’s completely real. We are in the process of an extensive redesign of the app and didn’t want to show off the old version too much because the new one is so much nicer-looking. You can <a href="http://thinkup.com/demo/ginatrapani">check out this demo</a> if you want to see how the old version looks.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-open-source">
                  <div class="faq-question">Isn’t ThinkUp open source? Can I run it on my own? Is ThinkUp.com any different?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>It sure is, and if you have the tech skills to run it on your own server, we think that's fantastic! (It is roughly about the same amount of work as getting WordPress running on your server.)</p>

                  <p>The version of <a href="http://thinkup.com/download/">ThinkUp that you can download</a> and install on your web server or <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp">clone from GitHub</a> is what we will run on ThinkUp.com, though we've built systems around it for managing payments and other infrastructure details.</p></div>

                  <div class="faq-question">How will the new company affect the application's open source development?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">It will make it better and faster! ThinkUp the company will support, enhance, and speed up development of the open source application because we'll have the financial backing to invest more time and resources into it. The open source app will always be free to download and run on your own server.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">I’m a developer! How can I build insights for ThinkUp?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Oh we love this question! Right now, there's a "Hello World" example insight that you can learn from <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp">on GitHub</a>, but we'll be publishing full API docs and a style guide for insights soon so you can really go crazy. It's just a short wait until we finalize the way those APIs and design elements look.</div>

                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-hiring">
                  <div class="faq-question">Are you hiring?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Maybe soon! It depends in part on how this funding campaign goes. The good news is that, if you've got something to contribute, you can do that now and we'll work to make it worth your while. Some people have contributed code to ThinkUp and we helped them get jobs at companies like Facebook or Google before we had a company ourselves. Some helped on design or documentation and we were able to refer more work to them, or hire them for projects. And some have been helpful in building the community, by answering questions or writing up useful blog posts, and we greet them with warm hugs and buy coffee when we're in the same town because it's great to make friends.</div>

                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-l10n-support">
                  <div class="faq-question">Does ThinkUp support languages other than U.S. English?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Not yet! ThinkUp’s interface is (currently) entirely in U.S. English, so you should be comfortable reading English if you want to use it now. We definitely want to localize and internationalize ThinkUp for everyone, and once we’ve got the resources to do it, we will prioritize exactly that kind of project.</div>

                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-device-support">
                  <div class="faq-question">Which devices does ThinkUp work with?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">ThinkUp is a web app, so it should work on any common device. We test on Mac and PC computers, iPad and Android tablets, and iPhones and Android phones. Anil has a Microsoft Surface, so we even fire it up on there sometimes.</div>

                  <div class="faq-answer">Not yet! But if enough members join in this campaign, we'll be able to do those kinds of apps sooner! If you want to build one around our APIs, get in touch.</div>
                </li>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-browser-support">
                  <div class="faq-question">Which browsers does ThinkUp work in?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Any browser released in the last 5 or so years should work fine. We test things out on Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. We test on Chrome and Safari on mobile devices too. We love you Opera folks, so please don’t email us, because ThinkUp will probably work, but we just don’t test on there. It probably won’t work well on that weird web browser thing on the Nintendo Wii.</div>

                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>Oh no! We're so sorry you had trouble signing up for ThinkUp. To fix it, let's cancel your failed signup and start fresh. Here's how:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>If you successfully authorized ThinkUp via Amazon Payments, you should've received an email confirmation from Amazon. If so, go ahead and cancel the authorization. To do so, log into <a href="http://payments.amazon.com">Amazon Payments</a>, click the "Edit My Account Settings" link, then click on "Manage my payment authorizations." You'll see an authorization to "THINKUP LLC." Click on the "Details" link, then click on the Cancel button.</li>
                  <li>Once you cancelled the authorization, you can return to ThinkUp and try signing up again. If you get an error message about a duplicate email address (from your failed signup), email us at <a href="mailto:help@thinkup.com">help@thinkup.com</a> and tell us the email address you signed up with and we'll delete it from our system. Once that's done, you can re-sign up.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>We're deeply sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks for your patience with us.</p>

                <h3>Crowdfunding questions</h3>
                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-crowdfunding-and-investors">
                  <div class="faq-question">How come you’re doing a crowdfunding campaign if you’ve already raised some money? Haven't you been critical of venture capital?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We raised a relatively small round of funding to be able to do immediate work like this campaign and to pay folks like professional designers to make ThinkUp good enough for the world to use.</p>
                  <p>But we're doing this crowdfunding campaign because that's what it's going to take to get ThinkUp out to the whole world. We need your help to make it real, to prove there's demand for this kind of app and this kind of company, and keep us as accountable to you as we are to our investors. We've carefully vetted the people and firms we're working with to make sure they support the larger mission of our company, and we'll be explaining just how different our perspective on money is from most startups.</p>
                  <p>If you'd like to learn more, we provide a lot more detail <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com/post/64323671907/thank-you-to-everyone-whos-invested-in-our-success">on our blog</a>.</p></div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Why aren’t you using Kickstarter or Indiegogo?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>We love those platforms! But this isn't a one-time thing for us; we're in it for the long haul. That's why we're asking backers to join us with a recurring subscription&mdash;rather than a one-time contribution&mdash;so we can iterate our app and our business over time. We had to build a subscription system anyway, so we decided to run this campaign on our own software to get a headstart on development and create a single gateway for our users.</p>
                  <p>Since we're using Amazon Payments, it should be just as easy to become a ThinkUp member as it is to back a Kickstarter campaign.</p></div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Is this all or nothing? What if you don't meet your goal?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">No, we’re launching no matter what. But if we don’t reach our goal, we’ll have to spend more time thinking about our business model and working with our users to figure out how to support ThinkUp's growth going forward.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Is this the same app you guys launched two years ago?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">No! We tore that all apart and made a whole new app on top of that engine. Now ThinkUp has a sleek new look. (We kept the name ThinkUp because it's an awesome name.)</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">What happened to Expert Labs?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">That's the non-profit research project where ThinkUp was born. It was always designed as a limited-duration project, so when it ended we focused on how to bring its output, like ThinkUp, to a broader audience. We're extremely thankful to the MacArthur Foundation and AAAS for shepherding the earliest versions of what would become our work today.</div>

                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-quantified-selfies">
                  <div class="faq-question">What does “quantified selfies” mean?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"><p>It's a play on the idea of "quantified self", which is the process of tracking aspects of your life in order to better understand them or improve them. When people log all the food they eat in a spreadsheet so that they can eat more healthy foods, that's quantified self.</p>

                  <p>In the case of ThinkUp, "quantified selfies" is riffing on the idea that analyzing what we do in our fun, sometimes silly, sometimes serious activities on social networks could be meaningful, too.</p></div>

                  <div class="faq-answer">Our founders have built apps and companies before, and learned a lot from doing so. Anil helped start Six Apart, the company that made Movable Type and TypePad, which was one of the first paid hosted services for people to sign up for on the Internet. Gina’s had a number of successful open source apps and projects, from Todo.txt today to Better Gmail and many other apps in the past, in addition to founding Lifehacker. Best of all, we’ve got a lot of help from our community, and from our friends who’ve made some pretty big apps and sites, too.</div>

                  <div class="faq-answer">All the members who join in this campaign will be able to use ThinkUp on January 15th. We know that some people have been waiting a while for the chance to use the app, and we’re sorry it took so long. We just wanted to take our time and get things right in the process of building ThinkUp not just as an app, but as a company.</div>

                  <div class="faq-question">Is having a centralized, hosted version of ThinkUp contradictory to wanting to make the web more open?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer"></strong> This one is something we struggled with for a long time. The reality is, it’s just much easier to make a user experience that’s as good as what people expect by having things at a simple website where people can sign up. We're putting a lot of effort into making sure the open source app and ThinkUp.com stay perfectly in sync, so that there’s a great experience whether you’re on our service or not.</div>

                <li class="faq-item" id="faq-country-club">
                  <div class="faq-question">Since you're charging for membership to ThinkUp, aren't you just going to cater to people with a lot of disposable income?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">We're very mindful of this danger. Our plan is to address this with deliberate efforts at inclusion once ThinkUp is more broadly available, but our judgment was that the benefits of a sustainable company were a prerequisite to addressing the larger issues of who we’re serving with ThinkUp. Please keep us honest on this.</div>
