      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unique insights:</strong> Your editors and writers get daily personalized email reports, offering dozens of custom analyses of their activity online, like which sites were linked to most, a gender breakdown of who is responding to their updates, and even what got a laugh.</li>
        <li><strong>Editorial inspiration:</strong> Beat reporters who follow key players in an industry get x-ray vision into subtle updates like when they change their Twitter bio&mdash;a great signal that a story might be developing. And reminders of what was driving engagement on social media on this day in years past can inspire great retrospective articles.</li>
        <li><strong>Learn from peers:</strong> Now, ThinkUp offers a unique view of activity across your entire team&mdash;exclusively for our media clients. Use it to review performance, or share it with the whole team so they can learn from each other's success.</li>
