      <p>ThinkUp is a simple new app that gives you information about the way you use social networks like Twitter and Facebook. In contrast to regular analytics or statistics apps, it uses plain, human language to explain how you’re doing and to help you achieve your goals, whatever they are. ThinkUp is a more fun way to make the most out of the time we spend online.</p>

      <h3 class="text-header">Our Company</h3>

      </div>

      <p>ThinkUp is also the name of the small company based in New York City that makes ThinkUp. Our cofounders are Gina Trapani and Anil Dash. We are working to make ThinkUp the company that treats its customers and community better than any other company in the technology industry. To that end, we’ve posted our <a href="https://github.com/ThinkUpLLC/policy/blob/master/values.md">Company Values</a>, and eagerly solicit public feedback and response to them.</p>

      <p>Given our company’s goals of making our time online more meaningful, and the values that we’ve documented, it’s only natural that our ThinkUp platform is open source. ThinkUp’s source code went public in 2009. Since then, ThinkUp’s become one of the most popular open source projects on GitHub, currently among the top 15 most active PHP projects. Ours is an inclusive and welcoming community, with a developer mailing list that has never had a flame war, as befits our company motto, “It is nice to be nice.”</p>

      <h3 class="text-header">Our Investors</h3>

      <p>ThinkUp is backed first and foremost by its customers, who funded our launch with a crowdfunding campaign in late 2013. We also have a number of extraordinary investors, including Bloomberg Beta, Quotidian Ventures, SK Ventures and 500 Startups. Our individual angel advisors are Amol Sarva and Jalak Jobanputra. We’ve <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com/post/64323671907/thank-you-to-everyone-whos-invested-in-our-success">publicly disclosed the structure of our funding</a>, for people who are interested in such things.</p>
