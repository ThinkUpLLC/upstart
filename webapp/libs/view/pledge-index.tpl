              <p>ThinkUp is a brand new app that connects your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram or other social networking accounts and tells you what matters and what's meaningful online. It works with whatever device you have: iPhone or Android, PC or Mac or iPad. ThinkUp can help you make more friends, listen better to your connections, or even learn a little bit about yourself.</p>

              <p>ThinkUp is also our new company, focused on the idea that people are looking for Internet companies they can trust. We're putting our users and community first, because we think that's the best way to be good to the Internet and all the people on it.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Our cofounders, Gina Trapani and Anil Dash, have been working to build ThinkUp for a few years. Gina was the founding editor of Lifehacker, created Todo.txt, an open data format and suite of task manager apps, and hosts popular podcasts This Week in Google and In Beta. Anil has been writing since the late 90s on his personal blog and in magazines such as Wired, and helped launch Movable Type, which was one of the earliest and most popular blogging apps at the beginning of the social media era.</p>

              <p>Gina and Anil have advocated for a more thoughtful technology and a better Internet for more than a decade. Instead of just writing or talking about it, ThinkUp is an effort to actually build a company and product that can make it happen. We’ve already joined forces with an enthusiastic and diverse open source community of contributors around the world who believe in that vision, and in our product. We hope you'll be the next to join our community by becoming a member of ThinkUp.</p>

              <p>ThinkUp is like a friend who shows you awesome things about your social network that you couldn’t find anywhere else. You just open up the app on your phone, tablet or computer, and see insights like these:</p>

                <li>We are NOT trying to offer reporting on brand impressions for conversion funnels</li>
                <li>We’ll never lock your information into some proprietary system, since ThinkUp is completely open source.</li>
                <li>ThinkUp does NOT change its terms of service all the time without telling you about it.</li>
                <li>We do NOT tolerate people being jerks to each other in our developer community;  After almost four years, our mailing list has never had a flame war.</li>

            <div class="content">
              <p>We want to build another great Internet company, one that’s more focused on doing the right thing for its users and their communities than on taking over the whole web. We're starting by making an app that shows people exactly how meaningful their online interactions can be.</p>

              <p>Tens of thousands of geeky people have tried early beta versions of ThinkUp, but now we want to make it easy for anyone to use the app. So we are asking our community to subscribe to support the cost of developing ThinkUp into a reliable service backed by a sustainable company.</p>

              <p>You can pledge to subscribe to ThinkUp at the Member, Developer or Executive level, and be one of the very first users of ThinkUp in early 2014. When you do, you’ll help make ThinkUp available to everyone.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Every subscriber at every level gets great <strong>Member</strong> benefits as soon as we launch:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Be first in line to reserve your name on ThinkUp, and have immediate access when we launch in early 2014.</li>
                <li>All of ThinkUp’s dozens of insights, with support for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, YouTube and Foursquare.</li>
                <li>Invites for your friends to try out ThinkUp.</li>
                <li>An exclusive, brand new e-book, Insights, which explains what matters in social networking based on interviews with dozens of the most creative and influential users of social media.</li>
                <li>The ability to weigh in on changes to ThinkUp’s features, terms of service and product roadmap before those changes happen.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The <strong>Pro</strong> level is great for experts and geeks, with support for more social networking accounts, access to new beta ThinkUp features as they’re developed, and APIs and data services for building cool apps on top of ThinkUp. You can also weigh in on which open source features from the community make their way into ThinkUp.</p>

              <p>At the <strong>Executive</strong> level, you get all of the benefits of the other levels, plus you get access to our company’s inner workings. You’ll get email updates direct from ThinkUp’s founders with information about exactly where we’re headed, and what changes or improvements we’re going to make. This level is great for businesses, developers or organizations that rely on ThinkUp or that want to be directly involved in making the web better. You’ll also get a personalized version of the Insights book, inscribed with a message from our founders that’s custom-tailored to how you use social networks.</p>

                  <div class="faq-question">Isn’t ThinkUp open source? Can I run it on my own? Is ThinkUp.com any different?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">Yes! ThinkUp is totally open source, and if you know how to run it on your own web server, we think that’s awesome and want you to do it. But the vast majority of folks we talk to have said they want a service they can just sign up for and use, so that’s what we’re building. We don’t have any features currently planned for ThinkUp.com that aren’t available in the version you would download from GitHub, except for ease of use.</div>

                  <div class="faq-answer">So glad you asked! We’ve documented ThinkUp’s insights API here, and even created a style guide for how insights should look and feel.</div>

                <li class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question">Is ThinkUp just a stats or analytics app? How does it compare to my existing analytics program?</div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">While we do have a few charts and graphs, the goal of ThinkUp is to tell you things that ordinary analytics apps don’t. So instead of focusing on how many followers you have, we want to offer more perspective on the content you’re sharing, and how it makes people feel and respond.</div>
