      <p>ThinkUp LLC. takes the private nature of your
      personal information very seriously. We respect your privacy and strive to use
      your information in ways that you can understand, predict and control.</p>
      <h4>We&#39;ll use a few terms in this policy:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;: This policy regarding our privacy practices</li>
      <li>&ldquo;ThinkUp&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;: ThinkUp LLC</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Site&rdquo;: ThinkUp.com</li>
      <li>Services: ThinkUp&#39;s other domains, products, services, and/or content, along
      with the Site</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you
      visit and use the Services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to
      the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of
      your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Because your privacy is important, we ask that you please read this Policy
      carefully. We&#39;ve also included higlighted annotations throughout this policy;
      these annotations aren&#39;t a part of the policy itself, but are intended to help
      you follow the text and to emphasize key sections.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">1. Children</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We do not collect personally identifiable information from children.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Services are not directed towards, and ThinkUp does not knowingly collect
      information from, children under the age of 13. If you are a parent and
      believe your child under the age of thirteen (13) has created a Services
      account or otherwise provided personal information to ThinkUp, please
      contact us at help@thinkup.com.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">2. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;This Policy covers information you share with ThinkUp, not third parties.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you
      are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
      the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but
      not limited to any third party websites, services and applications
      (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;) that you elect to access through the Service or to
      individuals that we don&#39;t manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully
      review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">3. What Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
      <h4>Account Information:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;ThinkUp needs your account information like an email address and password.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>When you create an account on a ThinkUp Service (an &ldquo;Account&rdquo;), you will
      provide information such as your username, password, and email address.
      You may also be required to provide us with your birthdate, which we use
      to verify your age and may use to personalize the Services for you (e.g.,
      by presenting you with content relevant to your age group). This
      information may personally identify you. For example, if you use your full
      name as your username, you are disclosing your identity to the public.</p>
      <h4>Email Communications with Us:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;ThinkUp uses your email address to send necessary notificaitions.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other
      communications from us, such as administrative communications relating to
      your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset).
      These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account,
      which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. You can opt-out of
      some communications from ThinkUp, such as insight notifications; please
      see your Membership Settings page. Note that we will NEVER email you to
      ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an
      email, forward it to us at help@thinkup.com.</p>
      <h4>Information Obtained from Third Party Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;ThinkUp uses your data shared from third-party networks like Twitter and
      Facebook, and you should understand their policies.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: Key parts of the
      Services require you to link your Account to certain third party social
      networking services, such as Twitter or Facebook (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;).
      In order to do so, you will provide your user ID and authentication on each
      of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that allows us to
      access those accounts. We use this authorization as permission to, for
      example, retrieve your activity on those services.</p>
      <p>We do NOT ask for, receive or store your passwords for your Third
      Party Service accounts.</p>
      <p>For your convenience, you can view the Twitter Terms of Service here:<br><a href="https://twitter.com/tos">https://twitter.com/tos</a></p>
      <p>And you can view the Twitter Privacy Policy here:<br><a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a></p>
      <p>Also for your convenience, you can view the Facebook Terms of Service:<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms</a></p>
      <p>And you can view the Facebook Data Use Policy here:<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy</a></p>
      <p>We STRONGLY encourage you to familiarize yourself with the terms of service
      and privacy policy of any third-party services which you use in conjunction
      with ThinkUp.</p>
      <p>In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third
      Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party
      Services. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you
      have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available
      for ThinkUp to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use
      the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to
      improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly
      urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you
      disclose to Internet services, including ThinkUp and linked Third Party
      Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts together.</p>
      <h4>User Content:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Your ThinkUp insights are default by public.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>By default, the information we get from your accounts with Third Party
      Services and the anlysis generated by the Services regarding that
      information is public, and it is published so that anyone can view it. We
      provide tools, like privacy and security settings, that let you limit who
      can see information in your ThinkUp account. You should assume that
      anything ThinkUp publishes for you is publicly accessible unless you have
      explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is
      accessible to everyone, including search engines. In addition, information
      shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you
      are free to remove published content from or delete your Account, because
      of the nature of Internet sharing, copies of that content may exist
      elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including in our systems.</p>
      <h4>Information About User Content:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Your content might have data embedded in it. We may use that data.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the
      Services. For example, when it&#39;s included with your images, we may collect
      information describing your camera and camera settings, or when it is
      included in your posts on Third Party Services, we may collect location
      information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide
      additional features and functionality.</p>
      <h4>Financial Information:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Your payment details are stored at Amazon. You should read their policies.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We do not collect or store your financial information when you decide to
      purchase a paid Service; instead, such information is stored by our third
      party payment processor (the &ldquo;Payment Processor&rdquo;), and use and storage of
      that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of
      service and privacy policy (the Payment Processor may also have other
      terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself
      with those terms, as applicable). Currently, our Payment Processor is
      Amazon Payments.</p>
      <p>For your convenience, you can view the Privacy Policy for Amazon Payments
      here:
      <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/help?nodeId=82974">https://payments.amazon.com/help?nodeId=82974</a></p>
      <p>We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: a unique
      token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further
      purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor.</p>
      <h4>Information Related to Use of the Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We use third party statistics and analytics services. Read their policies.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We collect information about how people use the Services, including those
      with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and
      may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors,
      which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on
      the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may
      also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics
      and Chartbeat, to collect and analyze this information. This information
      enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
      individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some
      of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined
      below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your
      Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you
      visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that
      is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not
      identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services
      to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.</p>
      <p>For your convenience, you may view the Google Analytics Terms of Service:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a></p>
      <p>And you can view the Google Analytics Privacy Policy:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a></p>
      <p>Also for your convenience, you may view the Chartbeat Terms of Service:<br><a href="https://chartbeat.com/terms/">https://chartbeat.com/terms/</a></p>
      <p>And this is the Chartbeat Privacy Policy:<br><a href="https://chartbeat.com/privacy/">https://chartbeat.com/privacy/</a></p>
      <h4>Information Related to Your Web Browser:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Web browsers typically send some data when you visit us; We use that to make
      ThinkUp better.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when
      you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version,
      what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your
      language preference, the website or service that referred you to the
      Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen
      display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on
      your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether
      you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in
      a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is
      used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by
      personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not,
      however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
      <h4>IP Address Information:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Normally, when you visit ThinkUp we receive your IP address, which we&#39;ll use
      to improve ThinkUp.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>When you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we
      will collect and store your Internet Protocol Address (&ldquo;IP Address&rdquo;). We
      generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity
      theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for
      you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate,
      non-identifying, information about use of the Services.</p>
      <h4>Location Information:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If we receive your location information, we&#39;ll use it to provide better
      ThinkUp services to you.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>In some cases we collect and store information about where you are
      located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or
      by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We may
      use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.</p>
      <h4>Information Collected Using Cookies:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We use cookies to make ThinkUp work for you. If you turn them off, you won&#39;t
      be able to use ThinkUp. Some statistics services we use set cookies, too.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web
      browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies
      in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your
      cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our
      servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the
      Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that
      personally identifies you, and we don&#39;t combine the general information
      collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you
      are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and
      that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may
      associate that information with your Account if you have one. This
      information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on
      the Services, such as by presenting you with a different features when you
      are logged in to ThinkUp. Most web browsers have an option for turning off
      the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
      cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser
      software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
      variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won&#39;t be able to log into
      your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our
      Services; as such, we don&#39;t recommend disabling your cookies when using
      the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google
      Analytics and Chartbeat, may also place their own cookies on your browser.
      Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not
      cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
      <h4>Information About Your Contacts:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;ThinkUp automatically retrieves your friend or follower list from connected
      services.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact
      lists stored on other services. We only use and store that information to
      provide the ThinkUp service to you.</p>
      <h4>Derived Information:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We may deduce information about you from your activity. We only do that
      to provide the core ThinkUp services to you.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer
      characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These characteristics are
      used to improve and personalize the Services.</p>
      <h4>Email Tracking:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Sometimes we put a tracking link in emails to know if you opened an email
      or clicked on a link in it.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that
      allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may track which
      links in an email are followed. We also use the third-party email services
      MailChimp and Mandrill to deliver messages and you should review the
      policies of these services which govern these messages as well.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">4. Remarketing</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;“You may see more advertising for ThinkUp when you browse the web.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We may use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that
      allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Services that
      they will see elsewhere on the web. This is a common practice called
      “remarketing.” Users will not see more ads than they otherwise would see as a
      result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely to be ads for
      ThinkUp products and services.  Google and any other third party marketing
      services providers we use to help us with remarketing use cookies as part of
      the remarketing service. For more information regarding remarketing and the
      ability to opt-out, please visit:</p>

      <h3 class="hc">5. With Whom Your Information Is Shared</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We don&#39;t share your personal information without telling you.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We never share information we receive from you unless:</p>
      <p>(a) we have your permission to share that information;</p>
      <p>(b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this privacy policy)
      that the information will be shared, and with whom; or</p>
      <p>(c) that information is aggregate information or other information that
          does not identify you.</p>
      <h4>Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Your ThinkUp stream is public by default.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is
      shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services.
      Such information includes, but isn&#39;t limited to, anything you choose to
      post on or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in a
      posted photograph. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone
      and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be
      careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is
      information you want to share with everyone.</p>
      <h4>Information Shared Between the Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We might combine your use of different networks together to improve ThinkUp.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple
      Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services
      operate, and to develop new Services.</p>
      <h4>Information You Share with Third Party Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;ThinkUp relies on your activity on third party networks to work.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by
      clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share
      information that you provide to us, with those Third Party Services (for
      example, by sharing insights to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy
      only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading
      and understanding those Third Party Services&#39; privacy policies.</p>
      <h4>Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If we hire a contractor or consultant, they&#39;ll follow the same policy here.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses)
      with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other
      agents (&ldquo;Agents&rdquo;), for the purposes of operating and improving the
      Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in
      order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to
      information in the process of improving our processes and technology.
      Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally
      bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently,
      our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them
      beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby
      consent to our sharing of your information with our Agents.</p>
      <h4>Information Shared with Third Parties:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If we share information with business partners, it would be aggregate
      information.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We may share or disclose non-private information, information that is
      aggregated with information relating to other Service user that does not
      personally identify you, or other non-personally identifiable Information
      with people and entities that we do business with.</p>
      <h4>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If we sell ThinkUp or its assets, all of your private information would come
      along in the sale.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these
      transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred
      business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
      acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
      information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
      a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
      acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information
      as set forth in this policy.</p>
      <h4>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;We will disclose information if needed to obey the law or to protect people.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try
      to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also
      reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we
      reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy
      any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental
      order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service],
      including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
      prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues
      (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations
      for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user
      support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of
      us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but
      not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or
      self-harm.</p>
      <h4>Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:</h4>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;If you want to share your data, we&#39;ll accommodate you.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we
      will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">6. The Security of Your Information</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;Keep your password safe. We&#39;re doing everything we can to keep your data safe.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and
      security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and
      Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately
      and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you
      have finished accessing your Account on the Services.</p>
      <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your information (including your
      Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can&#39;t
      guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use,
      hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security
      of user information at any time.</p>
      <h3 class="hc">7. What Information You Can Access</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;You can see your account information in your Settings page.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information
      associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your
      Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and
      delete cookies through their web browser settings.</p>

      <h3 class="hc">8. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account</h3>
      <blockquote>
      &ldquo;You can email us to cancel your account, and we&#39;ll delete your account. Some
      information may persist for a while after your account is deleted.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Membership
      page or by emailing us at help@thinkup.com and providing proof of authority
      over the Account. What constitutes &ldquo;proof of authority&rdquo; will vary depending
      on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying
      information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting
      your Account may not fully or immediately remove the content you have
      published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or
      references to your Account information may not be immediately removed. In
      addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public
      activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers
      and accessible to the public.</p>

      information is used.</p>
