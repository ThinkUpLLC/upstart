      <h3 class="hc text-header">The Basics</h3>

      <h4 id="what-is"><a href="#what-is">What is ThinkUp?</a></h4>

      <p>ThinkUp is a service that gives you <strong>unique insights</strong> about you and your friends on Twitter and Facebook. We make the time you spend online <strong>more fun</strong>, with clever, plain-English tips and facts about what's happening on your social networks. And we're a different kind of tech company, trying to be a little bit more thoughtful and to live by <a href="http://localhost/join/about/values.php">our values</a>.</p>

      <p>When you <a href="https://thinkup.com/">join ThinkUp</a>, you get a simple stream showing you those insights about your Twitter and Facebook accounts. And those insights can come to you in a handy daily email, too.</p>

      <p>It's easier to understand ThinkUp by letting you try it than by explaining it, so you should probaby sign up for the free trial and see for yourself.</p>

      <h4 id="what-is-beta"><a href="#what-is-beta">What does it mean that ThinkUp is in beta?</a></h4>

      <p>That's our way of saying that some core ThinkUp features are still a work in progress. Because we’re still in beta, we're hard at work making the ThinkUp that you see today even more interesting in the future!</p>

      <h3 class="hc text-header">Membership and Pricing</h3>

      <h4 id="pricing"><a href="#pricing">How much does ThinkUp cost?</a></h4>

      <p>A ThinkUp Membership costs $5 per month and gathers insights from one Twitter account and one personal Facebook account.</p>

      <p>If you have more than one account on these networks, a Pro ThinkUp Membership costs $10 per month and gathers insights from a total of 10 Twitter and/or Facebook accounts.</p>

      <p>We also have custom Executive Memberships for larger companies or institutions that are more personalized. These start at $100/month and you can <a href="{$site_root_path}about/contact.php">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4 id="why-does-it-cost-money"><a href="#why-does-it-cost-money">Why does ThinkUp cost money?</a></h4>

      <p>ThinkUp costs moeny because we don't have ads and we don't do sketchy things with your data.</p>

      <p>We're committed to making sure our company and our product are sustainable and around for the long term. Our members say ThinkUp is worth it, because they like the service and believe in our company.</p>

      <h4 id="free-trial"><a href="#free-trial">Is there a free trial?</a></h4>

      <p>Yep! We offer a 14-day free trial. </p>

      <h3 class="hc text-header">Supported Services and Features</h3>

      <h4 id="which-networks"><a href="#which-networks">Which social networks will ThinkUp give me insights about?</a></h4>

      <p>ThinkUp works with Twitter and with personal Facebook accounts. In the future, we're considering adding Facebook Pages, Instagram and possibly other networks, based on the feedback we hear from our members. When you join ThinkUp, we'll let you know as we add those new networks in the future.</p>

      <h4 id="how-can-thinkup-help"><a href="#how-can-thinkup-help">How can ThinkUp help me?</a></h4>

      <p>We built ThinkUp to help you get more from the time you spend on your social networks. Instead of just numbers and statistics, ThinkUp delivers meaningful insights about your network activity. ThinkUp does stuff like this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Show you which friends updated their bios on Twitter</li>
        <li>Tell you which of your friends was your biggest fan on Facebook last week</li>
        <li>Help you decide whether you’re talking about yourself too much</li>
        <li>Give you a reminder about that funny tweet from your friend a year ago, in case you want to laugh with them about it again</li>
        <li>Let you know when someone in your neighborhood follows you on Twitter, in case you want to grab coffee with them</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ThinkUp is a great tool to use alongside conventional analytics and metrics services. While other platforms are far better at tracking conversion funnels, or focused on purely financial metrics, ThinkUp aims to show how well you’re using your social networks at a more <em>human</em> level.</p>

      <h4 id="language-support"><a href="#language-support">What languages does ThinkUp support?</a></h4>

      <p>ThinkUp works best for people who primarily use English on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

      <h3 class="hc text-header">Current Members</h2>

      <h4 id="reconnect-facebook"><a href="#reconnect-facebook">Why do I have to reconnect my Facebook account once in a while?</a></h4>

      <p>As an added security measure, Facebook asks users to explicitly reconnect apps like ThinkUp from time to time. We're working on ways to make the reconnection process smoother and less disruptive for our members.</p>

      <h4 id="change-username-email"><a href="#change-username-email">How can I change my ThinkUp username or email address?</a></h4>
      <p><a href="{$site_root_path}about/contact.php">Just contact us</a> with the change you’d like made and we’ll take care of it for you.</p>

      <h4 id="pro-upgrade"><a href="#pro-upgrade">How can I add more accounts to my Pro membership?</a></h4>

      <p>You can connect up to 10 total Facebook and Twitter accounts to your Pro membership. On Twitter.com or Facebook.com, log into the account you want to add. In ThinkUp, on the Twitter or Facebook settings page click the "Connect a Twitter account" or "Connect a Facebook account" button. Your ThinkUp stream (http://yourusername.thinkup.com) will include insights from all of your connected accounts.</p>

      <h4 id="self-hosted"><a href="#self-hosted"> Where can I get support for self-hosted installations of ThinkUp?</a></h4>

      <p>The best place to get help with your self-hosted ThinkUp is from the developer community. There is an active <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thinkupapp">mailing list</a> where you can search for the issue you’re having and post questions.</p>
