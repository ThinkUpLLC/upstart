      <h4 >What is ThinkUp?</h4>

      <p>ThinkUp is a simple new service that offers you a <strong>completely unique set of analytics</strong> about the way you use Twitter and Facebook.</p>

      <p>More broadly, ThinkUp is a smart new way to get more meaning out of all the time you spend online, offering little insights that help you no matter what your goals are online. And it’s built by a company and community that aim to respect you more than any other tech company.</p>

      <p>When you <a href="https://thinkup.com/join/">join ThinkUp</a>, you get a simple stream showing you those insights about your Twitter and Facebook accounts, which you can also get in a handy little email.</p>
      <p>You can see it in action on our cofounder <a href="https://ginatrapani.thinkup.com/">Gina’s ThinkUp</a>.</p>

      <h4>What does it mean that ThinkUp is in beta?</h4>

      <p>That's our way of indicating that there are still some core new features we'd like to refine before we feel like we've reached the first incarnation of what ThinkUp will eventually be. We've made ThinkUp available already because lots of people told us they wanted to use it!</p>
      <p>Because we’re still in Beta, we're hard at work making the insights in ThinkUp that you see today even more interesting in the future.</p>

      <h3 class="hc text-header">Membership and Pricing</h3>

      <h4>How much does ThinkUp cost?</h4>

      <p>A ThinkUp Membership costs $60 per year and gathers insights from one Twitter account and one Facebook personal account.</p>

      <p>A Pro ThinkUp Membership costs $120 per year and gathers insights from a total of 10 Twitter and/or Facebook accounts.</p>

      <p>We also offer custom Executive Memberships for larger companies or institutions that are more personalized. These start at $1000/year and you can <a href="https://www.thinkup.com/join/contact/">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4>Why does ThinkUp cost money? Is there a free trial?</h4>

      <p>ThinkUp costs money because we're committed to making sure our company and our product are sustainable and around for the long term. Our members say ThinkUp is worth it, because they like the service and believe in our company, especially as our product improves.</p>
      <p>We don’t have a free trial yet, but we do offer an effortless 100% money-back guarantee. 99.65% of our users don’t ask for it.</p>


      <h3 class="hc text-header">Supported Services and Features</h3>

      <h4>Which social neteworks will ThinkUp give me insights about?</h4>

      <p>Currently, ThinkUp works with Twitter and with personal Facebook accounts. We're working to add support for Facebook Pages, Instagram, YouTube, Google+ and possibly other networks, based on the feedback we hear from our members. If you join ThinkUp now, we'll let you know as soon as those new networks are added in the future.</p>

      <h4>How can ThinkUp help me?</h4>

      <p>We built ThinkUp to help you get more meaning from the time you spend on your social networks. Instead of just numbers and statistics, ThinkUp delivers meaningful insights about your network activity. ThinkUp does stuff like this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Help you decide whether you’re talking about yourself too much</li>
        <li>Tell you which of your friends was your biggest fan on Facebook last week</li>
        <li>Give you a reminder about that funny tweet from your friend a year ago, in case want to laugh with them about it again</li>
        <li>Let you know when someone in your neighborhood follows you on Twitter, in case you want to grab coffee with them</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ThinkUp is a great tool to sit alongside conventional analytics and metrics services. While other platforms are far better at tracking conversion funnels, or focused on purely financial metrics, ThinkUp aims to show how well you’re using your social networks at a more <em>human</em> level.</p>

      <!--
      <p>We like the way one of our current members, Jamie Rubin, <a href="http://www.jamierubin.net/2014/03/01/one-way-thinkup-has-already-started-to-change-my-behavior">describes</a> what ThinkUp is doing for our community: "[ThinkUp is] allowing users to take useful information (and hints!) from the insights and use them to <strong>improve the quality of their online social presence</strong>."</p>
      -->

      <h3>Why do I have to keep reconnecting my Facebook account?</h3>

      <p>As an added security measure Facebook makes users re-connect from time to time. We're working with Facebook to try to make this less frequent.</p>

      <h3>How can I change my ThinkUp username or email address?</h3>
      <p>Email help@thinkup.com with the change you’d like made and we’ll take care of it for you.</p>

      <h3>How can I upgrade to a pro membership?</h3>

      <p>We're so glad you want to take your relationship with ThinkUp to the next level! During our beta period we don't have an automated upgrade process but if you email help@thinkup.com we'll take care of the upgrade for you.</p>

      <h3>Where can I get support for self-hosted installations of ThinkUp?</h3>

      <p>For issues with self-hosted installations of ThinkUp the best place to get help is from the developer community. There is an active <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/thinkupapp">Google Group</a> where you can search for the issue you’re having and ask questions.</p>
