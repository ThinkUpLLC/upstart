 * This controller sends email reminders to ThinkUp members who abandoned payment.
 * Eventually, it will be deprecated by free trial.
 *
 * For first reminder, select all subscribers who are not on the waitlist, whose subscription_status is 'Payment due','
 * 'whose total_payment_reminders_sent = 0, and whose creation_time is more than 24 hours earlier than now.
 * Cycle through them and send first reminder, setting total_payment_reminders_sent = 1 along the way.
 *
 * For the second reminder, select all subscribers who are not on the waitlist, whose subscription_status is
 * 'Payment due', whose total_payment_reminders_sent = 1, and whose last_payment_reminder_sent is more than 48 hours
 * earlier than now. Cycle through them and send second reminder, setting total_payment_reminders_sent = 2 along
 * the way.
 *
 * For the final reminder, select all subscribers who are not on the waitlist, whose subscription_status is
 * 'Payment due', whose total_payment_reminders_sent = 2, and whose last_payment_reminder_sent is more than 96 hours
 * earlier than now. Cycle through them and send third reminder, setting total_payment_reminders_sent = 3 along the way.
